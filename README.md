# AI-Based Plant Identification and Growth Guidance System 

##  Overview
This project is an **AI-powered plant identification system** that integrates **image recognition** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.  
It uses multiple ML/DL algorithms (CNN, Random Forest, YOLO, Transfer Learning) to classify plants and a **chatbot** to provide real-time plant care guidance.

##  Features
-  **Plant Identification** using CNN, Random Forest, YOLO, and Transfer Learning  
-  **Chatbot Integration** for plant care queries  
-  **Comparative Analysis** of different algorithms with accuracy metrics  
-  **Growth Guidance** with personalized suggestions  
-  **User-friendly Interface**  

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn  
- **Chatbot:** NLP (NLTK / spaCy)
